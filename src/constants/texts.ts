export const MY_BIO = `I initially began programming with a focus on Backend development using languages such as PHP and C++. I spent a considerable amount of time working in the Backend field and from the outset, I recognized my affinity for product design. However, my passion for programming didn't permit a switch in domains. Therefore, I endeavored to continue in the Frontend realm.
I have a long journey ahead, and one of my most significant objectives in this career is to enhance my capabilities in Frontend development. I aim to concentrate on refining my skills and accumulating substantial experiences in this domain. My priority lies in collaborating with companies that provide an environment conducive to growth and learning in the Frontend field.`;
